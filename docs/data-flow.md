# Data flow — Ka0s Quick Comms

## Today: a setting changes

```
panel checkbox ─┐
/qc set|enable ─┼─> NS.SchemaRuntime.Set(path, v) ─> store ─> [Set] line ─> row.onChange ─> announce
launcher entry ─┘                                                   │                    │
                                                    Settings.REACTIONS[path]       panel refresh
                                                    (enabled → the latch's `disabled` hold)
```

Every module reads a setting back through `NS.Setting(path)`.

## Today: enable and disable

`enabled = false` → `Lifecycle:Set("disabled", true)` → `NS.StandDown`: every `NS.FEATURE_EVENTS`
row unregistered, tracked bus registrations taken down, each module's `NS.STAND_DOWN` step run. The
stand-up re-registers and runs each `NS.STAND_UP` step from current settings. The perf harness's
suspend takes the same latch's `perf` hold.

## Today: a profile event

AceDB's switch, copy or reset → `reloadProfile` (`core/QuickComms.lua`): the migrations,
`Library.Prepare()` (seed, append newly shipped built-ins, repair the registry, lift `nextId`), a panel
refresh, the latch re-read from the incoming profile's `enabled`, then `NS.MSG.PROFILE_CHANGED`.

## Today: a restriction or combat edge

`ADDON_RESTRICTION_STATE_CHANGED` or a `PLAYER_REGEN` edge → `Restrictions` (it owns both
`PLAYER_REGEN` rows) → when the set of blocking reasons moves, `RESTRICTION_CHANGED (reason,
canSendChat)` → Situation refreshes the snapshot's `lockdown` and `inCombat` in place. The signature
does not move and no `SITUATION_CHANGED` is sent.

## Today: `/qc check <id>`

```
/qc check ─> Library.Callout(id) ─> Situation.Current() ─> Bake.Bake(callout, snapshot, {soloFallback})
                                                                 │  tokens, channel, sanitize
                                                                 ▼
                                              line, channel, bytes, lock  ─> NS.Print   (never sends)
```

This is the whole phase 1 pipeline: the stages up to the baked line exist, and nothing consumes the
line but this verb.

## The design's callout pipeline (spec §4.1)

```
 game events ─► Situation ──SITUATION_CHANGED──► Resolver ──ACTIVE_GROUPS_CHANGED──► Surfaces
 (zone, key,    (classify the                 (When rules → active           (Pad, Dial:
  group, spec,   snapshot)                     groups, per-surface order)      layout, render)
  restriction)                                     ▲                                │ slot plans
 Library (the registry writer) ──LIBRARY_CHANGED───┘                                ▼
                                                              Bake (tokens, channel, sanitize →
                                                              one macro line, out of combat)
                                                                                    │
                                                                                    ▼
                                         SendEngine (the only secure-attribute writer: button pool,
                                         combat-end queue, bindings, spam guard, echo tracker)
```

The README's `## How the callouts work` is the same pipeline told for players. Situation, Resolver, Library and Bake exist; Surfaces and
SendEngine are phase 2, and this page grows with them.
