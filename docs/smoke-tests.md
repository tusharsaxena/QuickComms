# Smoke tests — Ka0s Quick Comms

The in-client checks the headless suite cannot make: what the real client draws, what its events
really carry, and what Blizzard's restrictions really allow. Run them on a clean `/reload`, with
debug logging off unless a check says to turn it on (`/qc debug on`). Record each result on its
`Result:` line with the date, the client build and pass or fail (and what was seen when it failed).
IDs are `<THEME>-<n>`: a new check takes the next free number in its theme, and a retired number is
never reused. A number marked *reserved* is promised to the feature named beside it, which writes
the check when it lands. These checks are the owner's to run; an agent never marks one passed.

## Index

| ID range | Theme | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| INSTALL-1..3 | Install | Load, reload, first run, the logo |
| SLASH-1..2 | Slash | `/qc` and `/quickcomms`, help, a slash collision |
| PANEL-1..3 | Settings panel | Landing page, General → Master controls, the Defaults button |
| PROFILE-1..2 | Profiles | The Profiles page and the `profile` verb |
| STATE-1..2 | State | Enable/disable, the launcher menu |
| COMBAT-1 | Combat | The settings panel in combat |
| DIAG-1..2 | Diagnostics | The debug console, the report, perf |
| DEGRADED-1 | Degraded | The install with LibKa0s missing |
| SEND-1..n | Send | Secure sends in keys and on bosses, the spam guard (reserved, phase 2) |
| PAD-1..n | Pad | The Comms Pad (reserved, phase 2) |
| DIAL-1..n | Dial | The Comms Dial and its bindings (reserved, phase 4) |
| LOC-1 | [Non-English client](#non-english-client) | What a deDE or frFR client changes |

## Before you start

- Install the addon folder as `Interface\AddOns\QuickComms` and `/reload`.
- Keep the debug console closed unless a check opens it; `/qc debug` opens it.

## Install

**INSTALL-1. Loads clean.** `/reload` with only Quick Comms enabled → no Lua error, no chat line at
login, the addon listed in the AddOns list with the gold speech-bubble logo. Result:

**INSTALL-2. Minimap button and broker.** Look at the minimap → the speech-bubble button is there;
hover it → the tooltip reads `Ka0s Quick Comms  v0.1.0`, `Enabled: Yes`, then the two click hints. A
missing icon (a blank or green square) is the failure. Result:

**INSTALL-3. Reload keeps settings.** Untick **Minimap button**, `/reload` → the button stays
hidden; turn debug logging on with `/qc debug on`, `/reload` → it is off again (session-only).
Result:

## Slash

**SLASH-1. Help.** `/qc help` and `/quickcomms help` → the same index, gold commands, white
descriptions, every row present; `/qc` alone opens the settings panel. Result:

**SLASH-2. No collision on `/qc`.** With the addons you normally run enabled, `/qc help` → Quick
Comms' index, not another addon's. Another addon answering, or nothing at all, is the failure (design
spec §3's phase 0 collision check). Result:

## Settings panel

**PANEL-1. Landing page.** Settings → AddOns → Ka0s Quick Comms → the logo once (not twice after
switching pages back and forth), the notes line, and the slash command list. Result:

**PANEL-2. Master controls.** General → the `Master controls` tab: Enable Ka0s Quick Comms beside
Debug console, Minimap button below, then Reset all settings. Ticking Debug console opens the
console; unticking Minimap button hides the button at once. Result:

**PANEL-3. Defaults and Reset all.** Hide the minimap button, untick Enable, press the header's
Defaults button and accept → Enable is ticked again and the minimap button stays hidden. Result:

## Profiles

**PROFILE-1. The Profiles page.** Settings → Ka0s Quick Comms → Profiles → AceDB's page draws;
create a profile, untick Enable, switch back → the first profile is still enabled. Result:

**PROFILE-2. The profile verb.** `/qc profile` lists the profiles; `/qc profile <name>` switches,
and works while the addon is disabled. Result:

## State

**STATE-1. Disable stands everything down.** `/qc disable` → `/qc help`, `/qc version`, `/qc list`
and `/qc diagnostics` still answer; the minimap menu's Enabled entry is unticked and still clickable;
`/qc enable` → enabled again, and `enabled = true` is echoed. Result:

**STATE-2. Launcher menu.** Right-click the minimap button → one entry, Enabled, ticking the state it
shows and toggling it; left-click → the settings panel opens. Result:

## Combat

**COMBAT-1. The panel in combat.** Pull a training dummy and type `/qc` → a gray notice that the
panel can't open in combat, and no Lua error; with the panel already open on General, enter combat →
the page is covered and its controls refuse until combat ends. Result:

## Diagnostics

**DIAG-1. The report.** `/qc diagnostics` → the console opens with both markers naming Ka0s Quick
Comms and the `identity`, `settings`, `registration` and `integrations` sections; logging is on
afterwards. `/qc debug diagnostics` writes the same report again below the first. Result:

**DIAG-2. Perf.** `/qc perf` → the step panel opens with its own close mark; run A, B and finish →
the report prints with no bucket rows (none is declared yet) and no Lua error. Result:

## Degraded

**DEGRADED-1. LibKa0s missing.** Rename `libs\LibKa0s` and `/reload` → no Lua error; one chat line
says the library is missing; `/qc disable` and `/qc enable` still work; `/qc list` says the settings
CLI is unavailable; `/qc config` says the settings panel is unavailable. Restore the folder after.
Result:

## Send

Reserved for the send engine (phase 2): sends from a pad button in a Mythic+ key, on trash and on a
boss; the spam guard blocking a double press; the stale hint appearing and clearing. The C1–C9
checks of the phase 0 harness (design spec §19) are recorded in `docs/brainstorm/go-no-go/`, not
here.

## Pad

Reserved for the Comms Pad (phase 2): placement, lock, test mode, combat freeze.

## Dial

Reserved for the Comms Dial (phase 4): hold, flick and release in a boss, the two-stroke categories,
the battleground node dial.

## Non-English client

**LOC-1. A deDE or frFR client.** What this build reads that a locale can change, enumerated from the
code: nothing. It reads no localized `_G` string, parses no tooltip line, keys nothing off a display
string, and writes no header another tool parses; its own strings are English through `NS.L`, which
answers the key itself on any client. The checks that will carry locale risk arrive with the
situation engine (instance and difficulty matched by id, never by name, design spec §6) and the
callout tokens (spec §8.1). Until then, on a deDE or frFR client: `/reload`, run `/qc help` and
`/qc diagnostics` → English text throughout, no Lua error, and no stray `%s` or `%d` in any line.
The failure looks like a raw format token in chat or a missing label. **Signed off without the
client** while the enumeration above holds: the headless cases `test_slash` and `test_diagnostics`
cover every line printed today, and the English client's INSTALL and SLASH checks are sufficient. The
section is re-armed by the situation task, whose check replaces this paragraph's "nothing". Result:

## Pending sign-off

| ID | Origin | Why it is owed |
|---|---|---|
| INSTALL-1..3, SLASH-1..2, PANEL-1..3, PROFILE-1..2, STATE-1..2, COMBAT-1, DIAG-1..2, DEGRADED-1, LOC-1 | The phase 0 scaffold | No client pass recorded yet |
